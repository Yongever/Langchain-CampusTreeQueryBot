# Question answering system over SQL & CSV data

# Architecture

At a high-level, the steps of these systems are:

Convert question to SQL query: Model converts user input to a SQL query.
Execute SQL query: Execute the query.
Answer the question: Model responds to user input using the query results.
Note that querying data in CSVs can follow a similar approach
